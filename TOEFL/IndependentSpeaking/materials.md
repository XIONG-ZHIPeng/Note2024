# Relax


In my view, a job-sharing arrangement can benefit many people. Admittedly, as A mentioned, it is possible for employers **find it difficult to** monitor progress. However, in today's society, teamwork is essential for everyone. Almost all companies' projects are so complex that no one can **accomplish them alone**. Therefore, teamwork is essential, and job-sharing **aligns well with this need**.

Secondly, job-sharing allows people to be free from full-time jobs, as B said. With more spare time, people can explore their interests **rather than immersing themselves entirely in** their jobs. This way, they can free their minds, which benefits their creativity and helps the company run better for a long-term success!


------------------------------------------------

Today, students are **juggling** studies, work, **and numerous other responsibilities**. They **strive to maintain strong academic performance** while also **preparing for** job hunting, which often involves acquiring new skills. These demands can lead to significant stress, **adversely affecting** both their mental and physical health. If universities were to offer a range of **recreational** activities, such as a movie theater or sports events, it could **have a significant positive impact on** students' **overall development**. These opportunities would help students learn to **balance work and study with leisure**, benefiting them in many aspects of their lives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my opinion, **pursuing** an advanced degree full-time **is preferable to** studying part-time while
 working. While some **individuals**, like Claire, can manage both work and studies effectively, 
 many **find it challenging to** achieve high effiency in both areas **simultaneously**. 

 For example, I **am majoring in** Computer Science **with a focus on** Natural Language Processing. **In my situation**, the research I conduct **is often unrelated to** my job's requirements. This **discrepancy** forces me to **juggle** two distinct sets of tasks, which significantly **reduces my overall effiency**. Thus, studying full-time would **allow me to focus solely on** my academic work, 
 leading to better performance and **a more thorough understanding of** my field.

 In my opinion, **pursuing** an advanced degree full-time **is preferable to** studying part-time while working. Although some **individuals**, like Claire, can **successfully balance both work and studies**, **many struggle to** maintain high efficiency in both areas **simultaneously**.

For instance, I **am majoring in** Computer Science **with a focus on** Natural Language Processing. **In my case**, the research I conduct often **has little relevance to** my job's requirements. This **mismatch** forces me to **manage two distinct sets of responsibilities**, which significantly **reduces my overall efficiency**. Therefore, studying full-time would **allow me to concentrate solely on** my academic work, leading to better performance and a deeper understanding of my field.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my view, the school should not limit the teaching of fictional texts. Admittedly, in today's society, there are numerous resources available online, as Claire mentioned. However, students are overloaded with subjects and assignments such as math, physics, engineering, and so on. It is essential for students to have a break from these overwhelming burdens, and teaching fictional texts aligns well with this need.

If the school offers fiction classes, students can immerse themselves in another world, which **benefits them greatly**. By reading fictional texts, students can **expand their vocabulary and enrich their cognition** while relaxing. Students can maintain excellent academic performance only when they are **sufficiently relaxed**!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In my view, I prefer relaxing with a plan. Admittedly, as Kelly mentioned, some manage their work and studies during the weekdays and **are tired of** their schedules. However, I believe a suitable plan can improve the quality of relaxation due to **the limited free time**, as Claire mentioned.

For instance, when I studied in high school, I only had a half day to take a break each week. When the spare time came, I had many things I wanted to do, such as shopping, visiting friends, seeing a movie, and so on. If I did not have a plan, I was absolutely unable to finish the things I wanted to do. If I have a plan, I can **immerse myself in the activities** I have planned, like reading. So, from my viewpoint, a schedule can improve my efficiency and help me focus on relaxing!

# Convenient

Living in the big city offers **a high level of** convenience, **with easy access to** theaters, galleries, and **a wide range of** activities that aren't as **readily available** in the countryside. For instance, if I **crave a snack** in the evening and I don’t have any at home, I can simply **head out** to find a 7-Eleven or another convenience store. There, I can **pick up** a variety of snacks to satisfy my craving. **This would be much more difficult** in the countryside, where most stores close by 6 p.m.

- lead to a better life


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my view, the best strategy for governments is to build infrastructure that attracts people to rural areas. While some individuals **are content with** farming, as Claire mentioned, it’s **unrealistic** to expect everyone to **pursue this lifestyle**. Therefore, we need to consider why so many people prefer **city living**. 
The main reason is the convenience that cities offer—access to shops, cinemas, hospitals, and more, as Kelly pointed out. For instance, many people enjoy **participating in** various activities, such as concerts, comic conventions, and art exhibitions. These events **are typically hosted in** large cities, not rural areas, which **compels people to** live in urban environments to **fully enjoy their lives**. However, if the government invests in infrastructure that supports these activities in rural areas, I believe more people would choose to live outside the city

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my view, the location is more significant than other factors. Admittedly, almost all companies offer various recreational places beyond just cafeterias, as Kelly mentioned. However, a large city can provide employees with convenience, with easy access to museums, galleries, comic conventions, and so on. **Compared to living in rural areas**, where employees may only **have the option to** play games at home or take walks in their community, most people prefer to visit cultural places or participate in activities such as concerts, which are typically hosted in big cities rather than rural areas.

If a company is located in the city, employees can fully enjoy their lives, going beyond just eating and drinking, which indeed attracts many people!

-------------------------------------------------------

# Efficient

**From my viewpoint**, I **am inclined to** study in the library rather than at home. Because the library is quiet and everyone **concentrate on** their work, which **provides a suitable atmosphere for efficiency**.

**Achieving** high efficiency is **crucial**, enabling me to **complete more tasks** in less time. In my case, I am a university student who **is overloaded with** numrous assignments. Therefore, it is necessary for me to keep high level of effiency in study. In the library, I will not be distracted by trivial things, like news, messages from friends, people chatting and so on so that I can **meet various deadlines**. In this way, I can not only accomplish tasks fater, but keep an excellent academic performance.

--------------------------------------------------

In my view, a four-day workweek would definitely be a bad policy. As Claire mentioned, such a plan would increase **the number of work hours per day**. In today’s society, a five-day workweek with eight-hour days already makes employees exhausted. 
For instance, if workers work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., this means they have to wake up no later than 8 a.m. and come back home later than 6 p.m. If they get 8 hours of sleep, they have only 6 hours, which is very limited, to relax and spend time with their family. If the work hours increase, there will be no spare time for them to enjoy their lives or explore their own interests, which is harmful to workers' mental and physical health. If workers are unable to **achieve a work-life balance**, their efficiency will decrease. So, this policy is not wise!



-------------------------------------------------

 **From my viewpoint**, I prefer studying in the library rather than at home because the library is quiet, and everyone is focused on their work. This creates a suitable atmosphere for me to be efficient.

Achieving high efficiency is **crucial**, **as** it allows me to complete more tasks **in less time**. As a university student **overloaded with** numerous assignments, **maintaining a high level of efficiency** in my studies is **essential**. In the library, I am not distracted by trivial things like news, messages from friends, or people chatting, **allowing** me to concentrate on meeting various deadlines. This way, I can not only complete my tasks faster but also maintain excellent academic performance.

----------------------------------------------------------

# Economy & diversity

In my view, students should be graded not only on their performance but also on their effort. 
While grading based **solely** on performance may seem fair, as Kelly mentioned, schools are **more than just places** where knowledge is acquired. They also **have a crucial responsibility to** teach students how to navigate society, a responsibility that **goes beyond** simply imparting information. 
Grading based only on performance **overlooks the diversity of students' backgrounds**. For example, many schools now **offer** computer classes. Some students may already **be proficient with** computers before starting school, while others, **due to factors like poverty or growing up in rural areas**, may **have had little to no exposure to** them. Even if these students **put in their best effort**, they might still **struggle**. It would be **unjust** to grade them solely on their performance




-----------------------------------------------------------------

In my opinion, it would definitely be a bad policy for the government to control gas prices. Admittedly, if the price of oil rises, people will have to spend more if they want to drive to work, as Claire mentioned. However, in today's society, **the increase in** fuel prices usually originates from shortages of oil during particular periods. The truth is, as we consume more fuel, these phenomena occur more frequently. If we are aware of this fact, we have to admit that the policy will not work and will only waste public funds. What we should do is develop green energy. We should also **focus on** developing electric vehicles because there are numerous methods to produce electricity and electricity is clean energy.

----------------------------------------------------------

# Health & Environmental friendly

In my view, large institutions **play a more significant role** than individuals **in contributing to** pollution. Admittedly, as B mentioned, individuals' efforts can improve the local environment. However, the damage caused by large factories to the environment is **more widespread and severe**.

For instance, I lived in a small city with a factory nearby. When winter comes, smog hovers over the city. In this case, I am unable to see objects within three meters, which is quite dangerous when crossing the road. Besides, this smog **causes** many people **to cough**, and sometimes, even worse, some people cannot breathe and **must rely on** medical equipment.

--------------------------------------------------

In my opinion, **physical education** is more significant than other subjects. Admittedly, as Claire and Kelly mentioned, there are a lot of knowledge for children to learn. However, all of these are based on the children's health. If children are sick, these subjects **are of little value**. So the sports class **aligns well with this need**.

In today's society, the public usually focus on children's knowledge **while overlooking their health**, which leads parents to ignore their children's health. Moreover, in many sports, it is essential to teach the beginners the rules to **avoid the incorrect techniques**, which may damage the beginners' health. So I believe the sports classes are essential!

------------------------------------------------------------------

In my view, outdoor classes are absolutely beneficial. Admittedly, there are numerous subjects for students to study, as Claire mentioned. However, students **are usually overloaded with** these subjects and assignments, such as math, physics, foreign languages, and so on. The high pressure will definitely harm both their mental and physical health. Students need **relaxation** and they need classes to **free them from these burdens**. Outdoor classes align well with this need.

If schools offer outdoor classes, students can play outside with their classmates, which can **not only benefit their health but also improve their communication skills**. In this way, students can **achieve well-rounded development**. This will play a significant role in their lives.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Safe

In my view, **the decrease in the use of** cash is beneficial. Admittedly, some **are not accustomed to** e-money and find it challenging to keep track of their spending, as Kelly mentioned. However, these **phenomena** **originate from** **initial exposure** to e-money. There are numerous applications that help consumers record their **expenses**. People just need a little time to **adjust**.

Second, if we use **mobile payments** rather than physical money, we will not need cash anymore, which could reduce the crime rate because there would be no cash for criminals. Additionally, we can more easily keep track of our e-money in various ways to avoid telecommunications fraud.

---------------------------------------------------------------

In my view, **the main disadvantage of** early adopters is that the technology is often not stable enough and can **be prone to breaking**. As B mentioned, early adopters need feedback from users. Additionally, it is possible that there are bugs in the software.

For instance, a music software I often use released a new version last month. I upgraded the software to experience the new features and the new UI panel. Admittedly, the new UI panel is very attractive, and I believe **there is no other software that** is more beautiful than it. However, **within one day of updating**, a bug **appear**ed in the cloud music feature, and all of my cloud music songs were deleted. So, I believe instability is the most significant problem!
