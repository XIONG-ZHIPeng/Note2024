# Relax

for a long-term success

Nowadays, students are busy with studies, work and everthing. Not only they want to keep a good academic performance, but also they have to perpare for the job-hunting, like learning skills for that. With these factors, they will be stressed out, which is harmful for both their mental and physical health. If universities can provide various entertainment ways for students, simply like a movie theater, a sport game or something else, it will play a profound impact on students' all-round development. They can learn to work or study life balance, which is beneficial to them in all aspects.

# Convenient

Living in the big city is pretty convenient, convenience of the theathers, galleies, and other kinds of activities, which can't be enjoyed if I live in the countryside. To be more detailed, sometimes I want to eat snacks in the evening, while there is no snack at home. I can go to the streets, find a 7-11, the convenience store. I can buy various snacks I want to eat. This is diffcult if I live in the countryside, where all the stores will close up before 6 p.m.
