To be honest, Claire and Paul's viewpoints can indeed relieve the pressure of the housing shortage. In my **country**, there is no doubt that on the one hand, too many people live in the large **cities**, **while** on the other hand, fewer people live in the countryside. Based on their statements, I have a further solution to help solve the problem. As we all know, **nowadays**, it is convenient to **communicate** with each other online. So, we can let people, who are able to work or study on the internet, work or study online. If **these people** can **work remotely**, **it is not a big deal for them to live in the countryside**. So this can help solve the problem!

In my opinion, I second Andrew. I indeed think the gap year is a good opportunity for students to learn more about themselves. As we all know, students graduating from high school don't know what kind of life they expect because, for a long time, they have relied on their parents. Most of them don't realize their responsibilities for themselves, their parents, or even humanity. If they can take a gap year, they can try to make their own living and learn about the real world, the world away from the shield provided by their parents. Then, they can explore what they really want, which will help them in their future studies.

It is a fungus called *Phytophthora ramorum*, which infects trees and leads to serious damage in oaks, that the reading passage refers to. The reading proposes three methods to shield the forest from this fungus's attacks. The lecturer also gives a speech about this topic. However, she disagrees with the reading's statements. The lecturer uses three specific viewpoints. 

Firstly, in contrast to the reading's method of preventing human-assisted spread, the lecturer argues that the main factor in spreading the fungus is water rather than human-assisted spread. She points out that preventing human-assisted spread is ineffective because of water. 

Secondly, the reading passage describes that using fungicidal chemicals will be an effective way, while the lecturer disagrees with this. She argues that the effective period of the chemicals is just a few months. Besides this, the cost of this method is unaffordable if each tree is required to be injected.

Thirdly, the speaker points out that the damage caused by clear-cutting, which is the third method mentioned by the reading, will be greater than the damage caused by the fungus. Because it will cut a lot of healthy trees. And these trees are too rare to restore.

It is the Triassic Extinction that the reading passage refers to. The speaker gives a speech on the same topic as the reading passage. However, she holds a negative attitude towards the reading's explanation. The speaker uses three specific viewpoints to support her argument. 

Firstly, in contrast to the theory of the decline of sea levels, which is proposed by the reading as a probable reason, the lecturer argues that it is impossible. She mentions that the decline of sea levels happens from time to time, and it usually happens gradually, which can't lead to an extinction in a short time.

Secondly, the speaker points out that the SO2 released by volcanoes is unable to cause the extinction, while the reading suggests it can. The speaker argues that although the SO2 would be absorbed by the atmosphere, the atmosphere is large enough to hold it without causing a significant lowering of global temperatures.

Thirdly, the reading refers to an asteroid strike as a cause of the extinction. The speaker disagrees with this. She points out that there are no findings that show an asteroid strike during that period. Additionally, the craters found are millions of years older than the Triassic Extinction.

The challenge of colonizing Venus is what the reading passage refers to. The reading believes the environment on Venus is too terrible to establish a human settlement. The lecturer gives a speech on the same topic. However, he holds a positive attitude about colonizing Venus. He provides three specific reasons to argue that it is possible to colonize Venus. Here are the details:

First and foremost, in contrast to the traditional way of settling on the surface of Venus, where atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth's surface, as mentioned by the reading, the lecturer argues that we can build a floating station above Venus. The higher altitude means lower pressure, thus overcoming the first problem.

Secondly, while the reading suggests that transferring water from Earth to Venus is impractical, the lecturer states that there are various easily-obtained compounds on Venus. Using these compounds, it is feasible to produce water in the station.

Lastly, although the reading claims that very little sunlight can reach the planet's surface, the lecturer points out that the station is above Venus. This means the station can not only utilize the sunlight but also use the reflected light to power the station.
