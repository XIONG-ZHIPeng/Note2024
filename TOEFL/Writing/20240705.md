# Triassic Extinction

**Reading:**

At the end of the Triassic period 200 million years ago, there was a mass-extinction event that caused the extinction of more than half of all living species. It was this extinction event that allowed dinosaurs to become the dominant species for the next 145 million years. We do not know exactly what happened that eliminated so many species in a relatively short period of time, but there are several possible explanations.
One theory involves the decline of sea levels. Near the end of the Triassic period, sea levels were fluctuating. When sea levels fall, the habitats for ocean populations that live in the shallows and land species that live on the coast are destroyed. The destruction of coastal and shallow-ocean species would have had a profound effect on food chains worldwide, leading to mass extinctions.
Another theory involves massive climate cooling. The end of the Triassic period was marked by widespread volcanic activity. The volcanoes released large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2). A rise in atmospheric SO2 is known to cause a lowering in global temperatures. Such climate change could have devastated many species and led to the extinctions.
The third theory involves an asteroid strike. Asteroids (objects from outer space) occasionally collide with Earth. When an asteroid hits Earthâ€™s surface, it often displaces large amounts of soil and crushed rock, leaving behind a depression, or crater. The displaced debris is thrown up into the atmosphere where it can block out sunlight for many months or even a few years. A sufficiently massive asteroid impact at the end of the Triassic period may have blocked sunlight long enough for most plants to die and many animal species to then starve.





**My response:** It is the Triassic Extinction that the reading passage refers to. The speaker gives a speech on the same topic as the reading passage. However, she holds a negetive attitude towards the reading's explanation. And the speaker uses three specific viewpoints to support herself. Firstly, in contrast to the theory of the decline of sea levels, which is proposed by the reading as a probable reason, the leturer argues that it is impossible. She mentions that the decline of the sea levels happens from time to time, and it usually happens gradually which can't lead to a extinction in a short time. Secondly, the speaker points out that the SO2 released by volcanos is unable to cause the extinction, while the reading thinks so. The speaker refers that although the SO2 would be absorbed by the atomsphere, the atomsphere is large enough to hold them rather than causing a lowering in global temperatures. Thirdly, the reading refers to the asteroid strike which leads to extinction. The speaker disagrees with that. She points out that there is no findings that shows the asteroid strike during that period. Also, the craters founded are millions years before the Triassix Extinction.


**Correct the errors:**
The passage contains several grammatical errors, misspellings, and stylistic issues. Here is the corrected version:

"It is the Triassic Extinction that the reading passage refers to. The speaker gives a speech on the same topic as the reading passage. However, she holds a negative attitude towards the reading's explanation. The speaker uses three specific viewpoints to support her argument. 

Firstly, in contrast to the theory of the decline of sea levels, which is proposed by the reading as a probable reason, the lecturer argues that it is impossible. She mentions that the decline of sea levels happens from time to time, and it usually happens gradually, which can't lead to an extinction in a short time.

Secondly, the speaker points out that the SO2 released by volcanoes is unable to cause the extinction, while the reading suggests it can. The speaker argues that although the SO2 would be absorbed by the atmosphere, the atmosphere is large enough to hold it without causing a significant lowering of global temperatures.

Thirdly, the reading refers to an asteroid strike as a cause of the extinction. The speaker disagrees with this. She points out that there are no findings that show an asteroid strike during that period. Additionally, the craters found are millions of years older than the Triassic Extinction."

Key corrections:
1. Spelling errors corrected: "negetive" to "negative," "leturer" to "lecturer," "volcanos" to "volcanoes," "atomsphere" to "atmosphere," "findings that shows" to "findings that show," and "Triassix" to "Triassic."
2. Grammar corrections: Added "an" before "extinction," changed "herself" to "her argument," changed "that shows" to "that show," and "craters founded" to "craters found."
3. Stylistic improvements: Adjusted sentence structure for clarity and flow.

The reading passage discusses the Triassic Extinction. The speaker addresses the same topic but disagrees with the reading's explanation. She presents three specific arguments to support her stance.

Firstly, the reading suggests that the decline of sea levels could have caused the extinction. However, the speaker argues that this is unlikely. She explains that sea level declines occur periodically and usually happen gradually, which would not lead to a rapid extinction event.

Secondly, the reading proposes that sulfur dioxide (SO2) released by volcanoes contributed to the extinction. The speaker refutes this by stating that although SO2 would be absorbed by the atmosphere, the atmosphere is vast enough to contain the gas without significantly lowering global temperatures.

Lastly, the reading mentions an asteroid strike as a potential cause of the extinction. The speaker disputes this claim, noting that there is no evidence of an asteroid impact during that period. Furthermore, the craters that have been found date back millions of years before the Triassic Extinction.

Key improvements:
1. Simplified and clarified sentences for better readability.
2. Used "the speaker addresses the same topic but disagrees with the reading's explanation" for a smoother transition.
3. Clarified scientific explanations and logical flow.
4. Consistent use of scientific terms like "sulfur dioxide (SO2)" and "atmosphere."
