# P. Ramorum Fungus

In 1995 a microscopic fungus called Phytophthora ramorum, or P. ramorum, was first detected in the forests of the western United States. P. ramorum infects trees and causes particularly serious damage in oak trees: in many infected oaks, leaves wither rapidly, large cracks appear in the bark, and the trees die. A spread of P. ramorum represents a serious threat to the forests in the western states. Several methods of protecting the forests have been proposed.
First, stopping P. ramorum spores from spreading would surely be an effective method. Spores are small particles through which all fungi, including P. ramorum, reproduce. Researchers have discovered that many P. ramorum spores can be found along hiking or biking trails, suggesting human-assisted spread by way of shoes and bicycle tires. A few measures to prevent such human-assisted spread—like encouraging hikers to wash their shoes and installing new bike scrubbers on bicycle trails—would be an effective and low-cost way to stop the spread of P. ramorum.
Second, there are a few fungicidal (fungus-fighting) chemicals that can be used to protect the oak trees. Some of these chemicals stimulate the oak trees’ natural defenses against the P. ramorum fungus and have been found in small-scale tryouts to significantly reduce the likelihood that the oaks will be infected.
A third way to fight P. ramorum is a practice called clear-cutting. This approach starts with cutting and burning the diseased oaks, but it also involves cutting and burning the seemingly healthy vegetation (bushes and other kinds of trees) surrounding the oaks. This is done because some of the surrounding plants and trees may be infected even though they do not show any symptoms of the disease. Clearing large areas of vegetation in places where diseased trees are found is often an efficient measure to stop the spread of infections.

Here is the corrected passage with errors identified and rectified:

---

It is a fungus called *Phytophthora ramorum*, which infects trees and leads to serious damage in oaks, that the reading passage refers to. The reading proposes three methods to shield the forest from this fungus's attacks. The lecturer also gives a speech about this topic. However, she disagrees with the reading's statements. The lecturer uses three specific viewpoints. 

Firstly, in contrast to the reading's method of preventing human-assisted spread, the lecturer argues that the main factor in spreading the fungus is water rather than human-assisted spread. She points out that preventing human-assisted spread is ineffective because of water. 

Secondly, the reading passage describes that using fungicidal chemicals will be an effective way, while the lecturer disagrees with this. She argues that the effective period of the chemicals is just a few months. Besides this, the cost of this method is unaffordable if each tree is required to be injected.

Thirdly, the speaker points out that the damage caused by clear-cutting, which is the third method mentioned by the reading, will be greater than the damage caused by the fungus. Because it will cut a lot of healthy trees. And these trees are too rare to restore.

### Specific Errors and Corrections:
1. **Grammar and punctuation**:
   - "will infect" changed to "infects".
   - "gives a speech" instead of "give a speech".
   - Added "with" after "disagrees".
   - Changed "viewpoints" to "viewpoints:" to introduce a list.
   
2. **Content clarity and redundancy**:
   - Reworded "preventing human-assisted spread is ineffective because of the water" to "preventing human-assisted spread is ineffective because of water."
   - Removed redundancy in the first and second arguments by clarifying and simplifying sentences.

3. **Tense and agreement errors**:
   - "just few month" to "just a few months".
   - "if each tree are" to "if each tree is".

4. **Clear-cutting argument clarity**:
   - "damage of clear-cutting" to "damage caused by clear-cutting".
   - "will larger" to "will be greater".
   - "health tree" to "healthy trees".
   - "these trees too rare" to "these trees are too rare".

5. **Article and word choice corrections**:
   - "fungicidal chemicals will be effective way" to "fungicidal chemicals will be an effective way".
   - "the lecturer disagrees with it" to "the lecturer disagrees with this".
