# Colonizing Venus

- Many scientists believe it would be possible to maintain a permanent human presence on Mars or the Moon. On the other hand, conditions on Venus are so extreme and inhospitable that maintaining a human presence there would be impossible.
- First, atmospheric pressure at Venus’ surface is at least 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface. This means that a force of 100 kilograms is pressing down on every square centimeter of surface. All spacecraft that have landed on Venus have been crushed by this extreme pressure within an hour of landing. Almost anything humans might land on Venus would be crushed as well.
- Second, as far as we know, there are no reservoirs of water on Venus’ surface, and the planet’s atmosphere, made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfuric acid, contains hardly any oxygen or water vapor. Water and oxygen would therefore probably have to be supplied to Venus from Earth. The idea of ensuring a regular supply of water and oxygen from Earth is impractical in the extreme and would probably defeat the purpose of establishing a permanent station on Venus.
- Third, very little sunlight reaches the planet’s surface. About 60 percent of the sunlight that hits Venus is reflected back into space by the thick clouds that fill the atmosphere, which means that only 40 percent of the sunlight can get through the clouds. Below these clouds is a dense layer of carbon dioxide, which blocks even more light, so very little light reaches the surface. The lack of light would prevent the use of solar power cells, so humans could not get electricity to power their machines and equipment.

**My response:**
It is the challenge of colonizing Venus that the reading passage refers to. The reading believes the environment on Venus is too terrible to build up human settlement. The lecturer gives a speech on the same topic. However, he holds an positive attitude about colonizing. He applies three specific reasons to argue that it's possible to colonize Vernus. Here are the details: 

First and foremost, in contrast to the traditional way to settle on the surface of Venus, at where atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth's surface, mentioned by the reading, the lecturer argues that we can building a floating station above the Venus. The higher altitude means lower pressure, so it overcomes the first problem.

 Secondly, while the reading thinks we have to transfer the water from earth to the versus, which is evidencely impractical, the lecturer states there are various easily-obtained compunds on the Venus. Using these compunds, it is not a big deal to make water in the station.
 
  At last, although the reading says very little sunlight can reach the planets' surface, the speaker points out that the station is above the Vernus. This means not only can station make use of the sunlight, but also it's able to use the reflected light to power the station.

Certainly! Here's the corrected passage:

The challenge of colonizing Venus is what the reading passage refers to. The reading believes the environment on Venus is too terrible to establish a human settlement. The lecturer gives a speech on the same topic. However, he holds a positive attitude about colonizing Venus. He provides three specific reasons to argue that it is possible to colonize Venus. Here are the details:

First and foremost, in contrast to the traditional way of settling on the surface of Venus, where atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth's surface, as mentioned by the reading, the lecturer argues that we can build a floating station above Venus. The higher altitude means lower pressure, thus overcoming the first problem.

Secondly, while the reading suggests that transferring water from Earth to Venus is impractical, the lecturer states that there are various easily-obtained compounds on Venus. Using these compounds, it is feasible to produce water in the station.

Lastly, although the reading claims that very little sunlight can reach the planet's surface, the lecturer points out that the station is above Venus. This means the station can not only utilize the sunlight but also use the reflected light to power the station.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

Sure, here's a list of the corrections I made:

1. **Sentence Structure and Grammar**:
   - Changed "It is the challenge of colonizing Venus that the reading passage refers to" to "The challenge of colonizing Venus is what the reading passage refers to."
   - Changed "an positive attitude" to "a positive attitude."
   - Changed "he applies three specific reasons" to "he provides three specific reasons."
   - Changed "building a floating station above the Venus" to "build a floating station above Venus."
   - Changed "it overcomes the first problem" to "thus overcoming the first problem."
   - Changed "compunds on the Venus" to "compounds on Venus."
   - Changed "compunds, it is not a big deal to make water" to "compounds, it is feasible to produce water."
   - Changed "the planets' surface" to "the planet's surface."
   - Changed "the station is above the Vernus" to "the station is above Venus."
   - Changed "station make use of the sunlight, but also it's able" to "station can not only utilize the sunlight but also use."

2. **Spelling and Typographical Errors**:
   - Corrected "Vernus" to "Venus."
   - Corrected "versus" to "Venus."
   - Corrected "evidencely" to "impractical."
   - Corrected "compunds" to "compounds."

3. **Clarity and Consistency**:
   - Improved overall clarity and consistency by restructuring sentences for better flow and readability.
   - Ensured consistent use of terms and proper names, such as "Venus" instead of varying between "the Venus" and "Venus."

These corrections improve the readability and accuracy of the passage while maintaining the original meaning.
