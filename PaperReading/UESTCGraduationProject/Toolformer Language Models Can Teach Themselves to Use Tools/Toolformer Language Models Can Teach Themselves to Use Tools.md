# Note on "Toolformer: Languge Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools"

## Abstract
Language models(LMs) struggle with basic functionality, such as arithmetic or factual lookup, where much simpler and smaller models excel.

This paper introduce ***Toolformer***, a model trained to decide which APIs to call, to teach LLMs themselves to use external tools via APIs.
