\section{Which problem is addressed by the paper?}
Efficiently modify LLMs' outputs towards targeted queries while preserving overall performance across other unrelated ones

\textbf{For example:}
updating the knowledge of "\textit{The current British Prime Minister is Rishi Sunak}" 
modifies the response to "\textit{Who is married to the PM of the UK?}" 


\section{Why is it important?}

The dynamic nature of the world  necessitates frequent updates to LLMs to rectify outdated information 
or integrate new knowledge, thereby safeguarding their sustained pertinence.


\section{How is it solved?}
