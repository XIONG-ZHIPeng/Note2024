# Which problem is addressed by the paper?

- Traditional prompting strategies, which apply the same prompt to all dataset samples regardless of task complexity, often result in sub-optimal evaluations.

# Why is it important?

Traditional prompting strategies' limitation highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methods that can adapt to varying levels of task complexity.

# How is it solved?

Hierarchical Prompt Framework (HPF) employs five distinct prompting strategies, each tailored to different levels of task complexity.

Furthermore, the taxonomy incorporates an Adaptive Hierarchical Prompt framework, enabling an LLM, called prompt-selector to dynamically select the appropriate prompting strategy based on a given task complexity.
